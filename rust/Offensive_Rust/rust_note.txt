C to Rust things to Remember:
	C:            Rust:
	FALSE    == false as i32 
	NULL     == ptr::null_mut()
	sizeof() == <buffer>.len()
	LPVOID buffer (writeprocmem) == <buffer>.as_ptr as _
	lpStartAddress == Some(std::mem::transmute(<buffer>)) ; you have to transmute the buffer to a different type taken care of by the transmute function and it needs to be of type Option

Casting in rust uses the 'as' keyword
	ex: false as i32
